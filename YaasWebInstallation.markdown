Create `/etc/yum.repos.d/yaas.repo` with the following contents:

    [inventario]
    name=Inventario
    baseurl=http://dev.laptop.org/~dsd/inventario-repo/f16
    enabled=1
    gpgcheck=0

The basic setup corresponds to a typical Ruby on Rails application.

Install and enable mysql
    # yum install mysql-server
    # chkconfig mysqld on
    # service mysqld start

The yaas-web installation expects the `root` mysql user to have no password (you can add one after), and requires mysqld to be running (as above). Install it now:

    # yum install yaas-web

Install Passenger (this is not packaged in Fedora, so the installation is a bit long winded)

    # yum install ruby-devel httpd-devel apr-devel gcc gcc-c++ make
    # gem install passenger
    # passenger-install-apache2-module

> Follow the instructions to complete the Passenger installation. **Be sure to read the output of the final command, as you must make another change to the apache config (read the instructions)**.

Add the following to `/etc/httpd/conf.d/passenger.conf`
    PassengerDefaultUser apache
    PassengerDefaultGroup apache
> It's not exactly clear why this is needed. According to the <a href="http://www.modrails.com/documentation/Users%20guide%20Apache.html#PassengerUserSwitching">passenger docs</a>, PassengerUserSwitching (on by default) should cause yaas-web to run as the apache user (which is the owner of config/environment.rb). However, this seems to be broken at the time of writing: it runs as 'nobody' and is hence unable to write log files in /var/yaas-web/log. Adding these lines acts as a simple workaround.

If using SELinux, enable apache to run in permissive mode

 semanage permissive -a httpd_t

>This command enables apache to run in "permissive" mode, meaning that your whole apache installation ignores all policies normally enforced by SELinux. I tried, and ran out of patience before being able to produce a leaner way to get passenger and SELinux working together without error.

Modify the yaas-web communication configuration file:

    # vim /var/yaas-web/application/config/yaas.yml

Modify `/etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf`: uncomment the line `NameVirtualHost *:80` to enable name-based virtual hosting 

Rename /etc/httpd/conf.d/yaas-web.conf.example (removing the .example extension) and customise file to change the ServerName to one that is appropriate for the system.

(Re)start apache

    # /etc/init.d/httpd restart
