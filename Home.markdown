# YAAS (Yet Another Activation System) #

This system intends to be a minimalist, easy-to [install, manage, use], standards based alternative to <a href="http://activation.laptop.org">OLPC activation web interface</a>. Creating a safe environment for generating XO activations (leases and development keys) for local deployments.

## Assumptions

You should be using [http://dev.laptop.org/git/bios-crypto/ bios-crypto] for your activations generation.

## Packages
The system is composed of 2 packages:

* **yaas-server** provides the activation generation service. It must run on the same machine where the bios-crypto packages are installed.
* **yaas-web** provides a web application that acts as a proxy between users and all the activation generation processes.

## Architectural justification
Even when its possible to have all the packages running on the same machine, it is important to provide a mechanism to isolate from the outer-world the critical information that comes along with the bios-crypto packages, such as the private keys.

# Actors
The system currently support 2 actors.

* Administrator
* User

## Administrator
### Actions
Administrator is able to:

* Generate unlimited developer keys and leases.
* Manage system accounts (CRUD)
* Populate the black list

## User
### Actions
User is able to:

* Generate limited number of leases, for a limited amount of time each.

### Activations Bucket
* The bucket determines how many activations can be generated by a single user.
* Each user has their own bucket counter that gets decremented.
* This bucket counter can be modified by the system administrator.

### Duration limit
* The duration limit determines the maximum duration of a single lease activation. 
* Each user has their own duration limit. 
* This limit can be modified by the system administrator.

### Developer keys
* Each user could also create developer keys.
* This option is set by the administrator on each user individually.

# Installation - server

Create `/etc/yum.repos.d/yaas.repo` with the following contents:

    [yaas]
    name=Inventario
    baseurl=http://dev.laptop.org/~dsd/inventario-repo
    enabled=1
    gpgcheck=0

Install the package:

    # yum install yaas-server

Generate a key pair for the SSL security:

    # openssl req -new -x509 -days 9999 -nodes -out pkey-cert.pem -keyout pkey-key.pem

Put the keys somewhere safe, and change and restrict access to the user running the yaas-server, which has to match the user executing bios-crypto script:

    # chown OWNER pkey-*.pem
    # chmod go-rwx pkey-*.pem

Install bios-crypto (e.g. in the home directory of the user that will run yaas-server)
    # yum install git make gcc zlib-devel
    # git clone git://dev.laptop.org/bios-crypto
    # cd bios-crypto/build
    # make cli

Place your private master keys developer keys and leases at

* `bios-crypto/build/developer.public`
* `bios-crypto/build/developer.private`
* `bios-crypto/build/lease.public`
* `bios-crypto/build/lease.private`

Modify the yaas-server configuration file with your favorite text editor:

    # cp /opt/yaas-server/etc/yaas.config.example /opt/yaas-server/etc/yaas.config
    # vim /opt/yaas-server/etc/yaas.config

Start the server:

   # chkconfig yaas on
   # service yaas-server start

# Installation - web front end #

Create `/etc/yum.repos.d/yaas.repo` with the following contents:

    [yaas]
    name=Inventario
    baseurl=http://dev.laptop.org/~dsd/inventario-repo
    enabled=1
    gpgcheck=0

The basic setup corresponds to a typical Ruby on Rails application.

Install and enable mysql
    # yum install mysql-server
    # chkconfig mysqld on
    # service mysqld start

The yaas-web installation expects the `root` mysql user to have no password (you can add one after), and requires mysqld to be running (as above). Install it now:

    # yum install yaas-web

Install Passenger (this is not packaged in Fedora, so the installation is a bit long winded)

    # yum install ruby-devel httpd-devel apr-devel gcc gcc-c++ make
    # gem install passenger
    # passenger-install-apache2-module

> Follow the instructions to complete the Passenger installation. **Be sure to read the output of the final command, as you must make another change to the apache config (read the instructions)**.

Add the following to `/etc/httpd/conf.d/passenger.conf`
    PassengerDefaultUser apache
    PassengerDefaultGroup apache
> It's not exactly clear why this is needed. According to the <a href="http://www.modrails.com/documentation/Users%20guide%20Apache.html#PassengerUserSwitching">passenger docs</a>, PassengerUserSwitching (on by default) should cause yaas-web to run as the apache user (which is the owner of config/environment.rb). However, this seems to be broken at the time of writing: it runs as 'nobody' and is hence unable to write log files in /var/yaas-web/log. Adding these lines acts as a simple workaround.

If using SELinux, enable apache to run in permissive mode

 semanage permissive -a httpd_t

>This command enables apache to run in "permissive" mode, meaning that your whole apache installation ignores all policies normally enforced by SELinux. I tried, and ran out of patience before being able to produce a leaner way to get passenger and SELinux working together without error.

Modify the yaas-web communication configuration file:

    # vim /var/yaas-web/application/config/yaas.yml

Modify `/etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf`: uncomment the line `NameVirtualHost *:80` to enable name-based virtual hosting 

Rename /etc/httpd/conf.d/yaas-web.conf.example (removing the .example extension) and customise file to change the ServerName to one that is appropriate for the system.

(Re)start apache

    # /etc/init.d/httpd restart

# Contribute #

There are so many things to improve!
