# YAAS (Yet Another Activation System) #

This system intends to be a minimalist, easy-to [install, manage, use], standards based alternative to <a href="http://activation.laptop.org">OLPC activation web interface</a>. Creating a safe environment for generating XO activations (leases and development keys) for local deployments.

## Assumptions

You should be using <a href="http://dev.laptop.org/git/bios-crypto/">bios-crypto</a> for your activations generation.

## Packages
The system is composed of 2 packages:

* **yaas-server** provides the activation generation service. It must run on the same machine where the bios-crypto packages are installed.
* **yaas-web** provides a web application that acts as a proxy between users and all the activation generation processes.

## Architectural justification
Even when its possible to have all the packages running on the same machine, it is important to provide a mechanism to isolate from the outer-world the critical information that comes along with the bios-crypto packages, such as the private keys.

# Actors
The system currently support 2 actors.

* Administrator
* User

## Administrator
### Actions
Administrator is able to:

* Generate unlimited developer keys and leases.
* Manage system accounts (CRUD)
* Populate the black list

## User
### Actions
User is able to:

* Generate limited number of leases, for a limited amount of time each.

### Activations Bucket
* The bucket determines how many activations can be generated by a single user.
* Each user has their own bucket counter that gets decremented.
* This bucket counter can be modified by the system administrator.

### Duration limit
* The duration limit determines the maximum duration of a single lease activation. 
* Each user has their own duration limit. 
* This limit can be modified by the system administrator.

### Developer keys
* Each user could also create developer keys.
* This option is set by the administrator on each user individually.

# Requirements

Both packages are written in Ruby. Fedora Linux is the target platform; the installation documentation and packages are specifically targetted at Fedora. The software should also work fine on other distributions, but with non-Fedora setups you will be on your own in terms of installation, configuration and support.

The software is developed against Ruby 1.9.x. yaas-web is developed against Rails 3.0 and is expected to work against Rails 3.1, but this has not yet been tested.

**yaas-server** should work fine on Fedora 11 through Fedora 17.

**yaas-web** is intended for use on Fedora 17.
